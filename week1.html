    <h1>Week of 09/11/2020</h1>

    <p > 
        For this first blog post I will include the information from the start of the course to this week. 
        The first week, I learned the basic elements of html used to create a webpage and css. The box model
        was the first method we learned for presenting information on a webpage. Then we learned to bring the
        webage aesthetically into the modern era with flexbox. For example this is part of the style code being used for this webpage:
    </p>
    </div>
    
    <pre>
        <code>
            body{
                font-family: sans-serif;
                background-color: rgb(34, 34, 49);
                color: rgb(38, 247, 142);
                display: flex;
                justify-content: left;
                flex-direction: column;
            }
            .paragraph{
                word-wrap: normal;
                width: 700px;
            }
            pre code {
                border: 1px solid #999;
                display: block;
                width: 500px;
            }
        </code>
    </pre>
    <div class="paragraph">
        The big css element on display here is the flexbox model which we learned to replace the outdated box model. The flex-direction
        tag allows for these items to all appear on the vertical axis and makes it easy to read. If we wanted to see this webpage
        using the flex-direction row then it would look like this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16nm0__LUENmnj7-UvxeCmxfZbUM8cFwO/view?usp=sharing">less readable webpage</a>
        Thankfully we have learned some great uses of flexbox and its abilities to make a better looking webpage with the guidance of Dr. Chris Johnson and the abundance of css information
        at my favorite programming tutoring websites <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">GeeksforGeeks</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools.</a> GeeksforGeeks 
        helped me with the example code section, as the 'pre' and 'code' tags allowed me to create it.
        I also played around with the color attributes to come up with a color scheme that I thought was fun but it ended up just abraisve to the eyes. So I would like to
        figure out some color palettes that will work well with webpages in the future.

    <div id="deception">Also my site is considered a deceptive or dangerous site for some reason. I swear im not phishing your info. :/ but if you're so inclined:
         <input type="text" placeholder="Put Credit Card Info Here"></div>
